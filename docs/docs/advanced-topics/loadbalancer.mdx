[Load Balancers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-load-balancing/) are a crucial part of any distributed workload.
Piscina by default uses a [Resource Based](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/performance/types-of-load-balancing-algorithms/) algorithm (least-busy)
to distribute the load across the different workers set by the pool.

### Choosing the Load Balancing Algorithm

Choosing the right algorithm heavily depends on the requirements of each individual problem, and to assess
them by testing the implementation against several variations of workloads.

The algorithms can be grouped on:

#### Dynamic

Focused on taking decision based on heuristics from the workload.

It aims to balance the work by adapting itself to the environment and distribute the workloads equally across the different workers/nodes attempting to make better use
of resources or to minimize the time to finish each individual workload.

> Piscina uses a Dynamic algorithm, based on how busy the worker is (least-busy)

#### Static

Aims to distribute the workload based on a group of predefined factors.
It does not adapt to the environment, but rather aims to preserve the state of the distribution accordingly
to the values set beforehand.

This can be helpful under several situations where we want the workload to be distributed evenly or stick to a specific worker/node over time.

> Round Robin, Ring Hash, are just examples of these algorithms

It is heavily advised to understand the problem and the workload your pool will be facing, and tests heavily against the different algorithms that matches your
use case with several combinations to better understand its impact and how to manage it.
